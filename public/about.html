    <p>I'm Cindy Ekaji Mgbe</p>
    <p>
      I'm a Web Developer and UI UX Designer that's passionate about my work.
      Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives
      me to do my best.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals
      for myself, so I have something to strive towards. I'm not comfortable
      with settling, and I'm always looking for an opportunity to do better and
      achieve greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am highly organized. I always take notes and use a series of tools to
      help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and
      create a logical filing method so I can always find what I need.
